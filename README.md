# CAS Applied Data Science Material

Personal repository of schallersebastian for the CAS Applied Data Science program 2023/24 of the University of Bern.

The structure is based on the lead instructor's suggestions but was slightly modified as presented below: 
00_general (General introduction to Python and mathematics for data science)
01_Module_1 (Data Acquisition and Management)
02_Module_2 (Statistical Inference for Data Science)
03_Module_3 (Data Analysis and Machine Learning)
04_Module_4 (Ethics and Best Practices)
05_Module_5 (Consolidations)
06_Module_6 (Deep Learning)
07_final_project (Final project)

All module folders contain a subfolder with the provided lecture material (presentations, provided readings, and the original and modified Jupiter notebooks) and, if required, a second subfolder containing all material for the module's hand-in project/report. Folder 07 is the prelocated location for the upcoming final project, and folder 00 includes the course material of two introduction/refreshing courses held before the actual lectures.
