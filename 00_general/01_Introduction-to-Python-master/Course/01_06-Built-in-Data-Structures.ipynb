    "Python contains several other data structures that you might find useful; these can generally be found in the built-in ``collections`` module.\n",
    "The collections module is fully-documented in [Python's online documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html), and you can read more about the various objects available there.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, I've found the following very useful on occasion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``collections.namedtuple``: Like a tuple, but each value has a name\n",
    "- ``collections.defaultdict``: Like a dictionary, but unspecified keys have a user-specified default value\n",
    "- ``collections.OrderedDict``: Like a dictionary, but the order of keys is maintained\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've seen the standard built-in collection types, the use of these extended functionalities is very intuitive, and I'd suggest [reading about their use](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html)."

However in some memory intensive applications it might be also used to prepare the objects to be erased by the garbage collector of Python."
