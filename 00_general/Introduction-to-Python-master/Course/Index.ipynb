    "This course is based on the books below and the corresponding Jupyter notebooks of *Jake VanderPlas*. The course in its original format can be found on Github [in the book](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython) and the second part comes from the [book](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook). As reading from and writing to a file is belonging also to the basics, Kinga Sipos created the complementray Chapter *01.14-File Input and Output*. Chapter *01.18-Plotting* was also added to provide a first experience with plotting in Python. Some other little details were created and/or changed. Finally extra exercises were added in order to enhance the interactivity of the course."
